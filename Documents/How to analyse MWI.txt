How to analyse MWI

1. First you need to convert the dicoms into .nii files

dcm2niix dicomfiles

2. If (and this is likely the case) each echo is separate then you need to create a 4D volume of all the echoes (note that I'm assuming 48 echoes but if you have a different number then you must use that in these commands)

cp datafile_e1.nii.gz GRASE.nii.gz
for i in {2..48}; do
fslmerge -t GRASE.nii.gz GRASE.nii.gz datafile_e${i}.nii.gz
done

This will create a file (GRASE.nii.gz) that has all the echoes combined.

3. To calculate the MWF maps we use a program called DECAES (https://github.com/jondeuce/DECAES.jl). It runs in the programming language julia so you might need medIT to install that. Then you can grab the program off the github and run it. There's quite a bit of documentation for DECAES so it's worth some reading. 

julia --threads=auto decaes.jl -- GRASE.nii.gz --T2map --T2part --TE 8e-3 --nT2 40 --T2Range 10e-3 2.0 --SPWin 9e-3 40e-3 --MPWin 40e-3 200e-3 --Reg chi2 --Chi2Factor 1.02

Note: you need to input the correct TE. For us it's 8ms but I'm not sure what yours is.
This script will produce a few outputs but the important one is GRASE.t2parts.mat

4. Convert the matlab file into a .nii file

In matlab:
load('GRASE.t2parts.mat');
sfrmap=make_nii(sfr);
save_nii(sfrmap,'GRASE_MWF.nii');

Note:  a couple of these matlab functions may not be standard. I'm using the version that's in /data/workgroup/matlab/testing_functions on our server.

5. I usually have to do a little tweak to the MWF file to get the right dimensions

gzip GRASE_MWF.nii
fslcpgeom datafile_e1.nii.gz GRASE_MWF.nii.gz

6. After this I'll do registration and ROI creation. I'll share those commands when I get to them in my analysis which is likely after we collect our POST data.
