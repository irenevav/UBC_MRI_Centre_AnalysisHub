How to do basic DTI analysis

1. First you need to convert the dicoms into .nii files. This should be done for both the DTI and reverse B0 data.

dcm2niix dicomfiles

2. Grab the B0 volume from the DTI data (and the reverse Bo data if needed)

fslroi DTI.nii.gz DTI_B0.nii.gz 0 -1 0 -1 0 -1 0 1

The choice of parameters depends on whether you have your B0 volumes at the beginning or end of the DTI dataset. Here, I've assumed the beginning (ie the last entry [0 1] says to grab the 0th volume and include only 1 volume. [0 -1] says to include all the data so for x, y and z we're including all the data.
Another note is that if the dataset has an odd number of slices then you will need to remove one. This can also be done with fslroi but in the z component.Make sure you remove it for the entire DTI dataset as well as the reverse B0 data.

3. Merge the 2 B0 files into one

fslmerge -t DTI_B0_all DTI_B0 DTI_rev_B0

4. Start the topup analsyis procedure

First you will need to create a parameter file that tells the script how the data was collected. My acqparams.txt file looks like

0  1 0 0.08
0 -1 0 0.08

As long as the MR parameters are the same between the 2 B0 files then it doesn't really matter what the last value is. (It should be equal to the total readout time which can sometimmes be found in the json file.) The 1 and -1 indicate the direction of the phase encode.

topup --imain=DTI_B0_all --datain=acqparams.txt --config=b02b0.cnf --out=topup_PA_AP_B0 --fout=topup_PA_AP_B0_field --iout=topup_PA_AP_B0_unwrapped
applytopup --imain=DTI_B0,DTI_rev_B0 --inindex=1,2 --datain=acqparams.txt --topup=topup_PA_AP_B0 --out=topup_hifi_nodiff

5. Make a brain mask

bet topup_hifi_nodiff topup_hifi_nodiff_brain -m -f 0.2

6. Do eddy current correction

Need to create a file called index.txt which tells eddy what pahse direction the main DTI data was acquired in. As ususally the DTI data is collected all in the same direction as DTI_B0 then it's basically a file containing 1 for each gradient direction. (So for the 128 direction data, it's a file listing 1 128 times)

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... (continue for # of volumes in DTI.nii.gz)

eddy_openmp --imain=DTI --mask=topup_hifi_nodiff_brain_mask --index=index.txt --acqp=acqparams.txt --bvals=DTI.bval --bvecs=DTI.bvec --out=ECC --ref_scan_no=0 --ol_nstd=4 --topup=topup_PA_AP_B0

7. Calculate DTI metrics

dtifit --data=ECC --out=DTI --mask=topup_hifi_nodiff_brain_mask --bvecs=ECC.eddy_rotated_bvecs --bvals=DTI.bval

You will get a list of outputs DTI_... (because you specified the --out=DTI and it appends the results to that)
