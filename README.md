# UBC_MRI_Centre_AnalysisHub
Repository of Analysis pipelines for the UBC MRI Research Centre

This repository is designed to consolidate knowledge within the user base of the UBC MRI Research Centre. We hope to host analysis pipelines, tips and tricks and resources for MR analysis.

Heading up this initiative is Irene Vavasour (lees@phas.ubc.ca). Please contact me if you have suggestions, comments, questions, etc.
