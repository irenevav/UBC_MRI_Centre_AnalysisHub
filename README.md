# UBC_MRI_Centre_AnalysisHub
Repository of Analysis pipelines for the UBC MRI Research Centre

This repository is designed to consolidate knowledge within the user base of the UBC MRI Research Centre. We hope to host analysis pipelines, tips and tricks and resources for MR analysis.

The pipeline scripts have been written by users of the Centre. Let me know if you have something to add.

The Documents folder hosts most of the files that have been references in the monthly meetings. They are overviews of various topics with some how-to commands embeded within.

Heading up this initiative is Irene Vavasour (lees@phas.ubc.ca). Please contact me if you have suggestions, comments, questions, etc.
